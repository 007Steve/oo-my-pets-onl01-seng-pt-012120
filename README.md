# My Pets

## Objective

Learn how classes can interact with each other.

## Object Models

You will be building an Owner, Fish, Dog, and Cat class. Owner will know about all its pets, be able to buy a pet, set the name of a pet (which the pet can't change, because that would be weird), change a pet's mood through walking, feeding, or playing with it, and sell all of its pets (for when it moves to that tiny NYC studio after college).

We can accomplish all of this through building out methods that rely on methods like `attr_accessor` in another class.

## Instructions

Run the tests and build out your classes. Let the tests guide how to build your classes.
